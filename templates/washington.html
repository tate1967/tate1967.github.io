        <b><h3><span>Known as the father of the nation, George Washington (April 30, 1789 to March 4, 1797)
            served as the first president of the United States. He served as commander in chief during the
            American Revolution and afterward presided over the Constitutional Convention of 1787. With no
            precedent for selecting a president, it fell to the members of the Electoral College to choose
            the nation's first leader two years later. Over the course of two terms, Washington established
            many of the traditions the office still observes today. Deeply concerned that the office of
            president not be seen as that of a monarch, but as one of the people, Washington insisted that
            he be called "Mr. President," rather than "Your Excellency." During his tenure, the U.S.
            established rules for federal spending, normalized relations with its former enemy Great Britain,
            and laid the groundwork for the future capital, Washington, D.C.
