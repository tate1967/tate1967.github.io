        <b><h3><span>Thomas Jefferson (March 4, 1801 to March 4, 1809), the third president of
            the United States, also played an important role in America's birth. He drafted the
            Declaration of Independence and served as the nation's first secretary of state. As
            president, he organized the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the
            United States and set the stage for the nation's westward expansion. While Jefferson
            was in office, the United States also fought its first foreign war, known as the
            First Barbary War in the Mediterranean, and briefly invaded present-day Libya. During
             his second term, Jefferson's vice president, Aaron Burr, was tried for treason.
