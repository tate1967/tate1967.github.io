        <b><h3><span>Andrew Jackson (March 4, 1829 to March 4, 1837), known as "Old Hickory,"
            is considered the nation's first populist president. As a self-styled man of the
            people, Jackson earned fame for his exploits at the Battle of New Orleans during
            the War of 1812 and later against Seminole Indigenous people in Florida. His first
            run for the presidency in 1824 ended in a narrow loss to John Quincy Adams, but
            four years later, Jackson won the presidency in a landslide.  While he was in
            office, Jackson and his Democratic allies successfully dismantled the Second Bank
            of the United States, ending federal efforts at regulating the economy. An avowed
            proponent of westward expansion, Jackson had long advocated the forced removal of
            Indigenous peoples east of the Mississippi. Thousands perished along the so-called
            Trail of Tears under the relocation programs that Jackson implemented.
