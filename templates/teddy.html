        <b><h3><span>Theodore Roosevelt (September 14, 1901 to March 4, 1909) came to power after
            the sitting president, William McKinley, was assassinated. Elected at age 42, Roosevelt
            was the youngest man to take office. During his two terms, Roosevelt used the presidency
            to pursue a strong domestic and foreign policy. Roosevelt implemented regulations to curb
            the power of large corporations like Standard Oil and the nation's railroads. He also beefed
            up consumer protections with the Pure Food and Drug Act, which gave birth to the modern Food
            and Drug Administration, and created the first national parks. Roosevelt pursued an aggressive
            foreign policy, mediating the end of the Russo-Japanese War and developing the Panama Canal.
